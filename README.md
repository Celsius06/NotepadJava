# NotepadJava
My application can be launched by 2 ways:
1. Through my Main.java
2. Through the executable .jar file that I placed in my source code. Name of that .jar file is SimpleNotepad.jar

Here are some small notices:
The application can only be closed if:
- The text space is blank (like initially, you open my application and still not type in anything)
- User open an existing document and want to exit
- ......

For the video, because at the time I was recording, the noise around my place was quite loud since there was a working construction site nearby, so I needed to add some lofi music to drown it out. I'm sorry for that inconvenience. Please watch it if possible for a better perspective about what I do in my project, since the length for the report is quite short, and the report will not cover all about my application. Thanks for your understanding.

I have also implemented some common keyboard shortcuts for convenient use:
1. Ctrl + O: Open a previously saved text file
2. Ctrl + S: Save the current text file 
3. Ctrl + Shift + S: Save as (Save the current text file to a new directory, or save it with an another name,....)
4. Ctrl + N: Create a new blank page.
5. Ctrl + Z: Undo the last action.
6. Ctrl + X: Cut the selected text.
7. Ctrl + V: Paste the copied or cut text.
8. Ctrl + C: Copy the selected text.
9. Ctrl + F: Open the find dialog to search for text within the document.
10. Ctrl + H: Open the replace dialog to find and replace text within the document.
